# Geographic Information Systems and Science - Assessment Part 1


## Comparing two maps created in QGIS GUI and R language comand line environments



### Introduction

Spatial analysis, more than representing a specific academic field, produces a wide range of techicniques "to understand georeferenced data", from one side and creates applications and software packages as leading and increasing activities between analysts (Manfred, 2004). In this landscape, both the Geographic Information System and Science, one the tool and the knowledge the other, evolved togher with other disciplines to better represent the surface and the near surface of the Earth (Goodchild, 2009).  
Two different environments make it possible work with geographic data. First to mention are graphical user interface (GUI) open-source (QGIS, SAGA GIS, gvSIG, etc) and commercial products (ESRI, MapInfo, Bentley Systems, just to mention a few) and second comand line interface (CLI) frameworks. 
This work aims to produce and compare two maps using the POLICE.UK street-crimes data (https://data.police.uk/). The first spatial representation consists in using QGIS GUI analysing which streets show more crimes in Westminister Borough during August 2018, the second takes into consideration the street-crimes harm index of the same month within the City of London perimeter on R programming CLI environment. 


## Data

For this purpose the “Police.uk” web-site provides a large quantity of data in CSV format with x,y geographic coordinates. Particularly in this case, the London Metropolitan Police service was used to download the csv file which is released monthly, the latest record is August 2018. According to the methodology chose by authors, the file describes “individual crime and anti-social behaviour (ASB) incidents, including street-level location information and subsequent police and court ourcomes associated with crimes”(https://data.police.uk/about/#columns). Along with the Police data, other Open Street Map shapefiles were downloaded from the related Geofabrik website (https://download.geofabrik.de/) as of 1st October 2018 and used as cartographic background for the overall process.


##Methodology

The first map is produced using the QGIS GUI based-approach importing the Metropolitan Police cvs table and transforming it into points shapefile. A first visulisation of the new shapefile was created with style>simbology>Heatmap, this compute enfasizes the street-crime concetration around the London Soho area.

As a matter of deeper analysis, the focus area of this study is the Westminister Borough, which is the most afected in the whole London area. 
The next step consists on importing to the OSM streets shapefile and after buffering a distance of 30 meters from each street with Vector>Analysis Tools>count points in polygon,the buffer polygon is jioned with the streets shape that now contains also the numer of total crimes.
The map intents to visualize the streets-crime concentration through 5 classes of intensity in "Natural breaks(Jenks)" mode.

The second map utilizes a very similar method as developed for the first map but in this case through the CLI R langugage environment.After installing all the libraries required in RStudio, the first step is to to import the City of London Police csv data and make some appreciations about its content, visualizing a first graph.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(maptools)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(classInt)
library(OpenStreetMap)
library(rgeos)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
library(sf)
library(rgdal)
library(geojsonio)
library(ggplot2)

StreetCrimesAug_18 <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\week4\\AssessmentPart1\\DataInput\\data crime London\\278f379b19290400f4123e740fc18bae2bc00ae4\\2018-08\\2018-08-city-of-london-street.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")

## Inspect the content
names(StreetCrimesAug_18)
class(StreetCrimesAug_18)


str(StreetCrimesAug_18)
plot(StreetCrimesAug_18$Crime.type)
```


The next step involves setting the coordinate refences system to the cvs file that previously has been converted from data frame to spatial frame(sf). With the "st_write" function, the shapefile "Crimes08_18.shp" has been saved and imported as "Points_Crime_08" directly with the "readOGR" code line function from the computer. 

```{r}
## Specify the CRS to the CVS:
SC08_18_sp <- st_as_sf(SC08_18, coords= c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs= "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
+towgs84=0,0,0")

class(SC08_18_sp)


## Convert the csv in points shapefile:
st_write(SC08_18_sp,"C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\week4\\AssessmentPart1\\DataOutput\\Crimes08_18.shp", driver="ESRI shapefile")


## Import the street-crime points and the OSM City of London shapefile::
Points_Crime_08<-readOGR("C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\week4\\AssessmentPart1\\DataOutput\\Crimes08_18.shp")

CityofLondon<- readOGR("C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\week4\\AssessmentPart1\\DataOutput\\CoL_area.shp")

crs(Points_Crime_08)
crs(CityofLondon)
```


As an intermediate passage to the final visualization of this map, for all the crime types recorded in the csv file has been added a separate column called "Harm Index" which refers to the measure of harm based on "days in prison that crime will attract" on which Sherman et all (2016) investigated the possibility to associate each crime an index.

```{r}


print(Points_Crime_08)
print(CityofLondon)

levels(Points_Crime_08)
levels(CityofLondon)


osm_base<- read_osm(Points_Crime_08, type="esri", zoom=NULL)
qtm(osm_base)+
  tm_shape (CoL_area)+
  tm_polygons("code",
              alpha = 0)+
  tm_shape(Points_Crime_08)+
  tm_dots("Harm.Index",
          alpha=0.6,
          border.alpha=0,
          shape = 5,
          style="jenks",
          palette="YlOrRd",
          midpoint=NA,
          title = "Crime harm index")


```


```{r}

##preparing SHP for ggplotting:
CityofLondon_df<-fortify(CityofLondon)
StreetCrimesAug_18_df<-fortify(StreetCrimesAug_18)




plot(CityofLondon["name"],
     axes=TRUE,
     col= "red")
plot(Points_Crime_08['Crime.type'],
     main="Type of Crime - City of London Police records",
     axes=TRUE)



p <- ggplot(StreetCrimesAug_18, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude))
p + geom_point(aes(colour=Harm.Index))
  
d

map<- get_map(location=c(0.093337, 51.491376), maptype='roadmap', zoom=11)
map<-ggmap(map)
map<- map+
  geom_path(data=CityofLondon_df, aes(x=long,y=lat, group = group), color = 'darkblue', fill='white', size = 1)+
  geom_point(alpha=1/2, size=1.5,data=StreetCrimesAug_18, aes(colour=Harm.Index, fill=Harm.Index,x=Longitude, y=Latitude))+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x=NULL,
       y=NULL,
       title="Crime harm index", 
       subtitle="City of London Police - August 2018")
map 
  #scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-0.3, 0.0))
  #coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-0.3, 0.0),expand = FALSE)
  
  
  
  
  
print(map)
ggsave("C:\\Users\\Bogdan\\Documents\\UCL\\MRes\\GIS\\week4\\AssessmentPart1\\DataOutput\\map.png", width=25, height=11, dpi=250)
```




##Comparing the two work-flows

The GUI environment
benefits:when converting CRS in shapefiles is more explicit
drawbacks:

The CLI evironment
benefits: exporting different s files is very easy after learning some basic code, drawing grapgh from csv file, shapefile is very quick, reading the CRS is very quick in R. wide variety of potting solutions including interactive

drawbacks: neccessary to install and call libraries for more advanced coding,
when plotting functions are not shown directly, but different plotting service can be provided, getting the map form GoogleMaps requires an billing-activated Google Maps API.
When a function does'nt work is very difficult to find a solution, due to the fact the are a lot of hidden function, when plotting, if files don't have crs, we must fortify them, takes a long time to reproject the shapefiles
